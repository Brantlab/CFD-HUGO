A fire department auxiliary is a dedicated group of volunteers who provide invaluable support and assistance to the main fire department. Comprised of community members passionate about firefighting and public safety, auxiliaries take on non-operational tasks that enhance the effectiveness of the fire department. These tasks can include community outreach, fundraising, administrative support, logistics management, training and drills, and non-emergency assistance. By relieving firefighters of non-operational responsibilities, fire department auxiliaries help ensure that the department can focus on its core mission of emergency response and firefighting, ultimately making the community safer.

6. **6.** Rehab services: During prolonged incidents or emergencies, auxiliaries can provide support by setting up rehab areas, offering hydration and rest facilities for firefighters and other first responders.

7. **7.** Community events: Can represent the fire department at community events, parades, or public gatherings, promoting fire safety and fostering positive relationships with the public.
