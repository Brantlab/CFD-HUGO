Join us for a hometown favorite and one of our biggest community traditions! Each year, our volunteers fire up the griddles and welcome friends, families, and neighbors for a warm breakfast and a great cause. Expect plenty of pancakes, sausage, coffee, and good conversation — whether you’re grabbing a quick carry-out or sitting down to visit for a while.

All proceeds benefit the **Convoy Fire Association**, made up of the volunteers who serve our community. Donations from this event help fund equipment and improvements that directly support our Fire & EMS operations. Purchases are voted on by our membership to ensure funds go where they’re needed most.
