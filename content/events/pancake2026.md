We connect to our community every year with a fundraiser that brings all our members and community to a morning of amazing breakfast. We feature Pancakes, Sausage, Orange Juice, Milk, Coffee, and of course the laughs and conversation brought on by our dedicated volunteers!  
  
Money from this fundraiser goes into the Convoy Fire Association which is comprises of all volunteers on the Convoy Fire Department and the funds are used by voting on purchases that go directly back into Fire and EMS equipment.
