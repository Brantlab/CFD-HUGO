The Convoy Fire Department is excited to host a hydrant painting contest, set to be a highlight of the upcoming Convoy Community Days celebration. Participants of all ages are invited to showcase their creativity by painting fire hydrants throughout the town. This spirited competition will culminate in the selection of the top three hydrants, with prizes awarded to the winners. Judging will take place during the community festivities, offering a fun and artistic addition to the celebrations. This event not only promises to beautify the town but also aims to foster community spirit and engagement.
