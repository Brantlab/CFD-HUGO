We connect to our community every year with a fundraiser that brings all our members and community to a morning of amazing breakfast. We feature Pancakes, Sausage, Orange Juice, Milk, Coffee, and of course the laughs and conversation brought on by our dedicated volunteers!  
  
Money from this fundraiser goes into the Convoy Fire Association which is comprised of all volunteers on the Convoy Fire Department and the funds are used by voting on purchases that go directly back into Fire and EMS equipment.

### Bake Sale
We are also having a bake sale which the proceeds are going directly towards a purchase of a particular piece of fire rescue equipment called a [Turbo Draft](https://www.turbodraft.net/). A dependable solution to access static water sources that are not readily accessible using conventional drafting techniques.

Utilizing eductor technology and water pressure from the supply engine/pumper, the TurboDraft™ Fire Eductor allows us to tap into static sources such as lakes, ponds, streams, and swimming pools up to 250' away from the apparatus. Quick and easy to set up, the TurboDraft™ can be deployed in a matter of minutes, using standard 2 1/2" hose line and 5" LDH, to generate usable flows up to 670 GPM or more.
